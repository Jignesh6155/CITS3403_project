## Configuration

- **Environment Variables:**  
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required for resume analysis)
  - `SECRET_KEY` (required for session security; set in your .env file or environment)
  - `APP_CONFIG` (controls which configuration is used: `development`, `production`, or `testing`)
- **Database:**  
  - Default: SQLite (`careerlink.db`)
  - For testing: in-memory SQLite

---

## Application Configuration Modes

The application now selects its configuration class based on the `APP_CONFIG` environment variable. This is an industry-standard approach for flexible deployment.

### Available Configurations

- **DevelopmentConfig** (`APP_CONFIG=development`)
  - Used for local development.
  - Enables debug mode (`DEBUG=True`).
  - Uses a temporary secret key unless overridden by the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable.
  - Database: `careerlink.db` (SQLite file).

- **ProductionConfig** (`APP_CONFIG=production`)
  - Used for deployment/production.
  - Disables debug mode (`DEBUG=False`).
  - Requires `SECRET_KEY` to be set in the environment (no default fallback).
  - Database: `careerlink.db` (SQLite file, or override with your own URI).

- **TestingConfig** (`APP_CONFIG=testing`)
  - Used for running tests.
  - Enables testing mode (`TESTING=True`).
  - Uses an in-memory SQLite database (`sqlite:///:memory:`).
  - Disables CSRF protection for easier testing.
  - Uses a temporary secret key unless overridden by the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable.

### How to Use a Configuration

By default, the app uses `DevelopmentConfig` unless you specify otherwise. To change the configuration, set the `APP_CONFIG` environment variable:

- **In your shell or .env file:**
  ```bash
  export APP_CONFIG=production
  # or
  export APP_CONFIG=testing
  ```
  Or in `.env`:
  ```
  APP_CONFIG=production
  ```

- **What this does:**
  - `APP_CONFIG=development` ‚Üí DevelopmentConfig
  - `APP_CONFIG=production` ‚Üí ProductionConfig
  - `APP_CONFIG=testing` ‚Üí TestingConfig

- **No need to edit `run.py` to change environments!**

### Setting Other Environment Variables

- Create a `.env` file in your project root:
  ```
  SECRET_KEY=your-very-secret-key
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
  APP_CONFIG=development  # or production, or testing
  ```
- Or set the environment variable directly in your shell:
  ```bash
  export SECRET_KEY=your-very-secret-key
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
  export APP_CONFIG=production
  ```

**Note:**
- For production, always set a strong `SECRET_KEY` and do not rely on defaults.
- For development and testing, defaults are provided for convenience, but you can override them with your own environment variables.
